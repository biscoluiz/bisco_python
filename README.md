# Luiz Bisco's Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects that I have created. The projects are organized by category, and each project has its own README file that provides more information about the project.

I am a recent graduate of the FIAP School of Engineering and the UNISO School of Business Administration. I am passionate about data science and artificial intelligence, and I am always looking for new ways to learn and grow.

I hope you find these projects interesting and informative. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me.
